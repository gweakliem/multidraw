# multidraw

This is an application generated by Claude 3 Opus from Anthropic. To start, I used the prompt

```
make a multiplayer drawing app where the strokes appear on everyone else's screens in real time. Let user pick a name and color, save users to db on login
```

This project was inspired as an attempt to repeat the results reported in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mayfer/status/1765385826496864290) by Murat Ayfer.

Most of these instructions were generated by Claude when I prompted for more help

## Developing
Setup the project

```
npm init
npm install express socket.io mongodb
```



## Running

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

```
node server.js
```

or if you're using [bun](https://bun.sh/), which I did since Murat used that as his base

```
bun run start
```
